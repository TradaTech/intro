# Abstract

Blockchain is a useful and revolutionary technology which is getting a lot of attention recently. However, despite much anticipation, no significant blockchain adoption has been observed. 

Icetea is a platform designed to enable the first useful and widely-adopted decentralized application (dApp). In the long run, it aims to be a viable decentralized alternative to cloud computing platforms. 
 
The blockchain industry is yearning for the first ’killer app’ to validate this technology. Although plenty of blockchains exist with billions of USD invested, such an application remains elusive. If Icetea can do that, it is a game-changer.
